ðŸ§  What is EEG?
        EEG (Electroencephalography) is a method used to record the brainâ€™s electrical activity over a period of time. It is one of the most widely used techniques in neuroscience and medical diagnostics.

        ðŸ§¬ How does it work?
              The human brain communicates using electrical impulses.

              EEG works by placing small, metal electrodes on the scalp.

              These electrodes detect and record the electrical signals produced by the neurons in the brain.

               The signals are then visualized as waveforms, which represent brain activity.
ðŸ“Š EEG in this Project:
In this project, I used EEG data to detect whether a person is experiencing a seizure or not. Since EEG data is time-series (i.e., collected over time), I used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, which are well-suited for sequential data, to make accurate predictions.

ðŸ’¡ Why is EEG important?
        EEG is especially useful for diagnosing and monitoring:

        Epileptic seizures

        Sleep disorders

        Coma and brain death

        Encephalopathies

        Neurodegenerative diseases
